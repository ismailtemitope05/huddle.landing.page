Huddle Landing Page

This is my solution to the [Huddle landing page with a single introductory section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0) on Frontend Mentor. It helped me apply responsive layout skills and focus on visual hierarchy and structure.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** custom properties
- **Flexbox** & **CSS Grid**
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I Learned

I deepened my understanding of layout flexibility, mobile-first design, and overlap effects with CSS.

```css
.cta-overlap {
  background-color: var(--clr-white);
  color: var(--clr-Violet);
  text-align: center;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  margin: -5rem auto 3rem;
}
````

### Continued Development

I'm planning to:

* Improve accessibility and add dark mode support
